# Mirage

A new site platform designed specifically for single client websites with a set theme. Develop in plain HTML and CSS and then simply add a few lines of code to convert it to a fully functional website. Fully customize the internal editing display for each type of content so that you only see the inputs that you need.

## Download and Install

Mirage uses a number of git submodules. This means that if you would like to download it, either use a download from the `Releases` page on GitHub, or download the repository using Git.

If you use Git, make sure you run the command: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

## Access the Dashboard

Once you have downloaded and installed Mirage, go to `https://{your website url}/admin` to access the dashboard. You will be prompted for an email and password. During the setup process, the initial administrator account is created. Additional user accounts can be added from the dashboard.
