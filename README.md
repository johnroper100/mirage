# Mirage

A new site platform designed specifically for single client websites with a set theme. Develop in plain HTML and CSS and then simply add a few lines of code to convert it to a fully functional website. Fully customize the internal editing display for each type of content so that you only see the inputs that you need.

## Documentation

All documentation needed to develop themes is located [on our Wiki](https://github.com/johnroper100/mirage/wiki).
